;; Title: SDE004 Emergency Execute
;; Original Author: Marvin Janssen
;; Maintaining Author: Ryan Waits
;; Depends-On: 
;; Synopsis:
;; This extension allows a small number of very trusted principals to immediately
;; execute a proposal once a super majority is reached.
;; Description:
;; An extension meant for the bootstrapping period of a DAO. It temporarily gives
;; some very trusted principals the ability to perform an "executive action";
;; meaning, they can skip the voting process to immediately executive a proposal.
;; The Emergency Executive extension has a sunset period of ~1 month from deploy
;; time. Executive Team members, the parameters, and sunset period may be changed
;; by means of a future proposal.
